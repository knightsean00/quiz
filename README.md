# Udemy Quiz Coding Challenge
This is a basic web application with React in the front-end and FastAPI in the back-end. The application is hosted on Heroku and can be found [here](https://damp-woodland-22931.herokuapp.com/). The UI framework used is Bootstrap 5.0

I decided to use FastAPI because I just wanted to get some practice with the back-end framework. Since I had limited time, the application and the code does not look as appealing as I would have liked. I also would have added more integration tests to ensure the back-end and front-end were working properly together.
